# utility

A collection of self-hosted tools, each containerized with Docker.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [clock](./clock) | Workout interval timer (1 min work / 30 sec rest) |
| [TwelveReader](./TwelveReader) | EPUB audiobook reader with on-demand TTS and synchronized highlighting |
| [yt-whisper](./yt-whisper) | YouTube video downloader with GPU-accelerated Whisper transcription |
| [flashcard](./flashcard) | FSRS-based flashcard app with spaced repetition |
| [cloudflared](./cloudflared) | Cloudflare Tunnel — exposes all services via subdomains |

## Notes

1. Make sure to `.gitignore` `data/` and put all persistent files under it
2. Remember to register a subdomain in the Cloudflare tunnel dashboard for each new service
3. If a frontend container simply uses `frontend` as the service name it may collide on `my_network` — use `servicename-frontend` instead
